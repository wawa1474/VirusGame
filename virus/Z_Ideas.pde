/*
rather than have the codons decay over time
  have them decay a little if used

have cells replicate if empty space between them
  how do genome?
    just pick one at random and place it?
    have codon that checks for valid place and sets var if there is
      have codon that replicates host into previously selected place (uses energy like making UGO)
        can be used by virus to replicate out of control (place cells in any empty space)
  
RGL = Relative Genetic Location
UGO = Unidentified Genetic Object
